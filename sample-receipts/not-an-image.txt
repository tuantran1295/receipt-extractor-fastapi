# Full Stack Engineer
## Take Home Assessment (Receipt Exractor)

**\* Please read this entire document carefully before beginning the assessment. \***

## About

Congratulations on making it to the next phase of interviewing with Sleek!

For this portion of the interview, you will work on a small take home assessment to demonstrate and showcase your knowledge and skills. The assessment will cover both backend and frontend development, and should take _approximately 2.5 hours_ to complete.

While working on the assessment, you can do all of the work in a single sitting, or spread it out over a couple of days.

## Assessment project

For this assessment, you will be building the backend and frontend of a basic application that accepts images of receipts, uses an AI model of your choosing to extract the details of the receipts, and then displays the details in a simple frontend. You will also be required to implement unit tests for some of your backend code.

- For full details and requirements of the **_backend assessment_**:
  - [**Click here**](/engineer-assessment-backend/requirements-backend.md), or 
  - Go to the `engineer-assessment-backend/requirements-backend.md` document

* For full details and requirements of the **_frontend assessment_**:
   - [**Click here**](/engineer-assessment-frontend/requirements-frontend.md), or
   - Go to the `engineer-assessment-frontend/requirements-frontend.md` document

While working on the project, you will have the freedom to choose any _unspecified_ requirements, such as (but not limited to):

- File structure

- Data models

- Helper functions

- Data validation

- Error handling

- AI model and API/SDK

- UI/UX elements

You may use any AI model, API, or SDK of your choice to extract receipt data. This can include third-party services or open-source models. Please ensure that your approach is well-documented.

This is your project! While we have outlined the base functionality required for submission, we encourage you to demonstrate your own ideas, structure, and decisions throughout the project.

## Taking the assessment

The assessment has two components: a backend in NestJS, and a frontend in React.

We provide functioning boilerplate code of each component. The boilerplate code is _just enough_ to spin up with placeholder functionality. Everybody will start from the same place, and it is up to you to complete the assessment how you see fit.

### Project Initialization

1. Clone this repository locally

2. Follow the instructions within each project's README to install dependencies and spin-up the project

   - [Backend README](/engineer-assessment-backend/README.md)

   - [Frontend README](/engineer-assessment-frontend/README.md)

### Project Work

1. Create a new working branch (e.g. `git checkout -b working-branch`)

2. Complete all of your work in the working branch that you created above

   - All backend work should be within `engineer-assessment-backend/`

   - All frontend work should be within `engineer-assessment-frontend/`

2. Push commits to your remote working branch as often as you need

## Assessment Submission

There are **TWO** parts to submitting your completed assessment: 

1. **Submit your code via GitHub**

   a. Create a PR for your working branch into `main` branch

   b. Merge the above PR

   **⚠️ IMPORTANT: The above action is a one-time submission event. Do not open a PR until you are ready to submit your project.**

   _Please make sure your final submission includes updated_ `README` _files within the associated directories with instructions on how to run your project, any dependencies, and any other relevant details for reviewers. The repository will be private and not shared with anyone outside of Sleek._

2. **Fill-out and submit the Google form provided to you, with ALL the required information**

   _Note: We ask that you include a short demo video with your submission, showing the final working product, explaining the functionality and highlighting any important code/design choices you might have made. Please limit the video to 5 minutes max. You can make recordings up-to 5 minutes with a free_ [_Loom_](https://www.loom.com/) _account._ **_DO NOT submit your video on Youtube or other publicly-accessible sites._**

### Submission Checklist

- [ ] Code changes successfully merged into main branch

- [ ] Google form submission with the following details:

  - [ ] Email

  - [ ] Full name

  - [ ] Repository URL

  - [ ] Link to demo video

  - [ ] Use of AI tools in development

  - [ ] Feedback on the assessment (optional)

## Be prepared to discuss your submission

After submitting your completed assessment, there will be a 1-hour follow up technical interview. We will be asking you some questions about the work you’ve submitted, so make sure you understand it. Additionally, we will ask you to add or update functionality in this same project, so **DO NOT** delete your local branches after submission.

## Tips

#### Treat this like production code

Even though this is a short assessment, we expect you to treat it as though you were working on a production-level codebase. We want to see how you organize your work, what your thought process is, what libraries you might use, your use of Typescript, and so on. _A random number generator is not an appropriate way to generate unique IDs._

#### AI tools

We encourage the use of AI developer tools - such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or Cursor - **_to enhance your development process_**, but not to replace it.

That said, this is a coding assessment, and we expect you to demonstrate your own technical ability. AI can help you be more efficient, but it’s important that:

- _You fully understand the code you submit_

- _You can explain your decisions and logic during the review_

- _Your submission reflects your own problem-solving skills, not just copied output_

_Rely on AI like a smart assistant — not a substitute. Strong developers use tools to amplify their own skills, not to fill in for them._
