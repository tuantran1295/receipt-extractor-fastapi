# Receipt Extractor Backend

## Description

You are in charge of implementing a small application that automatically extracts information from a receipt image. The application will allow the user to upload an image of a receipt, which will be processed by an AI model to extract key details. The extracted contents will then be saved and returned to the frontend for the user to view.

## Objective

We want to implement a new service function that utilizes AI to extract details from a provided image of a receipt, and then expose this function in an API endpoint to be consumed by our frontend.

## Sample receipt images

The backend repository includes a `sample-receipts/` [directory](../sample-receipts/) containing a variety of receipt images that you can use for testing purposes during development.

## Requirements

Within the NestJS backend provided:

1. Create a new service function, `extractReceiptDetails`

   a. Accept an image file as an input

   - Only accept .jpg, .jpeg, .png file formats

   b. Send the image to an AI model of your choosing, along with with a prompt instructing the model to extract and return the following information:

   - Date

   - Currency (3-character currency code)

   - Vendor name

   - Receipt items (array):

     - Item name

     - Item cost

   - GST/tax (One GST/tax for the entire receipt)

   - Total

   _Note: You can choose to use whichever AI model you prefer, via their API or SDK_

2. Verify the response from the AI model

3. Save the image and the details of the extraction

   - _Whatever method you choose to store the extraction details and image should persist safely for any additional API endpoints or operations that might want to read or update the data_

4. Return the details of the saved extraction

   ```
   {
     id,
     date,
     currency,
     vendor_name,
     receipt_items: [
      item_name,
      item_cost,
     ],
     tax,
     total,
     image_url,
   }
   ```

2) Create and expose a new `POST` endpoint, `extract-receipt-details`

   a. Accept an image file as an input

   b. Invoke and return the response from the `extractReceiptDetails` service function created above

3) Create a unit test for your `extractReceiptDetails` service function that covers the following scenarios:

   a. Successful extraction from valid image

   b. Incorrect file type

   c. Invalid response from AI model (e.g. empty or poorly-formed)

   d. \`500\` status response
